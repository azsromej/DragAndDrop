# DragAndDrop
Drag and drop support for UIViews. Modeled after drag and drop on OS X. Dragging and hovering near the top or bottom of a UIScrollView causes autoscrolling so that a target can be scrolled into view.

I started this project in May 2015, worked it into a couple apps, then got sidetracked with Swift, debated rewriting the library, 
had surgery for kidney cancer, and finally watched some WWDC17 videos and realized drag and drop is supported in iOS 11.
