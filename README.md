# DragAndDrop
Drag and drop support for UIViews. Modeled after drag and drop on OS X. 

I started this project in May 2015, worked it into a couple apps, then got sidetracked with Swift, wondered if I should 
rewrite the library, had surgery for kidney cancer, and finally watched some WWDC17 videos and realized drag and drop is
supported in iOS 11.
